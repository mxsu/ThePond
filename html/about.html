          <br><br> What does the company do or offer?
        <ul>
          <li> It allows a growing independant artist to sell their art to customers without
            having to lose profits to fees on other websites like Etsy, RedBubble. It is also a better
            way to build brand recognition by having their own website and being able
            to easily link to it from external websites.</li>
          <br> Who is the company to potential customers? (as a person)
          <li> This website is a way for customers to be able to support the artist by buying art such as stickers,
            enamel pins, mousepads, tote bags, waterbottles, and apparel such as graphic tees, and sweaters. It is also
            a way for customers to contact the artist to ask for custom commissioned art, get updates on
            shipping, or a place to get updates on upcoming releases.</li>
          <br>
          <br> Why might this company entice someone to purchase a product or service
          <li> As a Canadian artist, we wanted to reduce waste and packaging from the shipping
            industry, so we offer local pickup in Vancouver, and free shipping in Canada with
            orders over $100! We also donate 10% of our waterbottle and tote bag sales to
